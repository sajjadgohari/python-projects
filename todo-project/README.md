# To-Do List Project

A simple **To-Do List Manager** written in Python.  
This project can be run in two ways:

1. **CLI (Command Line Interface)**  
   Run the app from your terminal and manage your tasks interactively.  

2. **API (via Postman - optional, for future extension)**  
   The code structure is ready to be extended with an API (e.g., Flask/FastAPI)  
   so that you can send requests via Postman to manage tasks.
